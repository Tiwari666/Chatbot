        "1)  Import Random Module: The random module is imported, which will be used later to select random responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Define the chat() Function:\n",
        "This function serves as the main logic for the chatbot.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)  Define Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        "greetings: Contains various greetings that the chatbot can respond to.\n",
        "\n",
        "responses: Corresponding responses to the greetings.\n",
        "\n",
        "questions: List of questions the chatbot can respond to.\n",
        "\n",
        "answers: Possible responses to the questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "identity: Statements related to the bot's identity.\n",

        "4) Print Initial Message:\n",
        "The chatbot starts with a greeting message.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Main Loop:\n",
        "The while True loop continuously runs until the user types \"bye\" to exit.\n",

        "\n",

        "6)  Handling User Input:\n",

        "If the user says \"bye\", the chatbot bids farewell and breaks out of the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the user's input matches any of the greetings, the chatbot responds with a random greeting from the responses list.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If the user's input matches any of the questions, the chatbot responds with a random answer from the answers list, followed by a prompt asking about the user's well-being.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the user's input matches any of the predefined identity-related questions, the chatbot responds with a random identity statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "If none of the above conditions are met, the chatbot asks the user why they said what they did.\n",
        "\n",
